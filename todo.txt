create board view
put images into places on board
create buttons that players can interact with
display player info below board
Implement player movement/locations

Deal scene cards to the board upside down
When player enters set, flip scene card face up

Fix:
OffCardRoles not moving to waiting area when scene wraps
Need to fix offSet when players are returning to sets that have cleared
Need to reset all sceneCards at the end of the day
