create board view
put images into places on board
create buttons that players can interact with
display player info below board
Implement player movement/locations

Deal scene cards to the board upside down
When player enters set, flip scene card face up

new bugs to deal with:
display results of acting

nullpointer in getplayeraction when a scene is done

When a player successfully acts and wraps a set, they are then able to move on the same turn
Upgrading also appears to be broken. It displays the proper options but doesn't allow a player to actually upgrade
Also possibly add something that tells a player the result of their roll for acting
Final notification announcing the winner of the game
