DeadWood, by Ethan Temple and Lachlan Imel. \n
To compile the code, make sure all files, including the board.xml and cards.xml file are all in the same folder. Run the program from the Deadwood.java class which contains our main. Just in case anything goes wrong while compiling, we coded our project on the lab machines running Ubuntu using VSCode, as well as Windows Systems using VSCode.
