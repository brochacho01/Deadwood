DeadWood, by Ethan Temple and Lachlan Imel.
To compile the code, make sure all files, including the board.xml and cards.xml file are all in the same folder. The images files should be setup so that there is an images folder. Then inside of that there is a CardBack image, board image and shot image. Then there should also be subfolders labeled cards and dice. Inside the cards folder there should be another cards folder and inside of that is where the card images should be, the same path idea applies to the dice subfolder as well. Run the program from the Deadwood.java class which contains our main. Just in case anything goes wrong while compiling, we coded our project on the lab machines running Ubuntu using VSCode, as well as Windows Systems using VSCode.
